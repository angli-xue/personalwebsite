> Hi! I am Angli Xue, a PhD candidate at [Program in Complex Trait Genomics (PCTG) group](https://cnsgenomics.com/) at University of Queensland, Australia. I am interested in dissecting the genetic architecture of human complex diseases, performing meta-analysis and integrating multi-omics data to identify associated gene loci and gene regulating mechanisms. 

> I'm currently working at [Prof. Jian Yang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=aLuqQs8AAAAJ&hl=en)'s laboratory, and my PhD thesis topic is "identification of genetic and modifiable risk factors for complex traits and diseases".
